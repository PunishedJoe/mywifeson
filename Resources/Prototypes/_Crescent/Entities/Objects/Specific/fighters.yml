  description: A light general utility fighter developed by the Chengridz Naval Committee. The common workhorse of the Homeguard Militia, deployed out of outposts, carriers, and heavy battleships alike for escort and harassment duty. Able to lay down decent support fire in a swarm or in a fleet, but struggles alone.
