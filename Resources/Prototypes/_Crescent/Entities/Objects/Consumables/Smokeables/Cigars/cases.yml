  description: A cigar case containing the sort of indulgence reserved for those who measure worth in fleets and factories. Each stick is rolled from genuine leaf, untouched by synth processes, carrying a taste the common rabble will never know. Scarcity only adds to their prestige as Imperial raids and sabotage on supply convoys have turned every shipment into a gamble, where a single draw might cost more than a laborerâ€™s year.
