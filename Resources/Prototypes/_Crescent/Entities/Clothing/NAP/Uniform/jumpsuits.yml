  description: the New American Ranger Corps' patented variant of olive drab provides little camouflage or obscuration in space, but harkens back to a time and a homeland that the wearer will one day stand upon once again. There is a long-standing rumour that a black pattern was rejected for infringing upon Imperial decree.
